I have a black [Dagne Dover fannie pack](https://www.dagnedover.com/collections/ace-fanny-pack) that I'd like to review today.
<!--more-->
## Description

It's a black neoprene fanny pack with a small zippered compartment in front, a zippered main compartment, and a smaller pocket in back. It has a plastic clip and an adjustable length strap.

## Narrative

Apparently Dagne Dover is an expensive designer. This was another Wirecutter recommendation. It looks like I can get the exact same thing [here as a knock-off]({{<amazon "B09221VHWX">}}). That's the thing about fashion: you can practically duplicate the thing as long as you don't label it as an original.

This sure comes in handy when I don't have any pockets. I can squeeze my wallet, keys, phone, [AirPods]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-08">}}), and ham radio in here. I'd probably make it about 20% bigger -- for me.

The strap can get long enough to wear over a shoulder, or I can cinch it across my waste. But it doesn't seem to stay cinched and I'm always re-tightening it after a little while lest it slip off my fanny and onto the ground.

### Functionality

Some would say it's more functional than fashionable, but it is trying hard to do both. The main area has a zipper that holds your stuff in. What more could you want?

### Quality

It is high quality and I notice no rips, tears, or pulled stitches.

### Reliability

It is perfectly 100% reliable to hold my things and about 75% reliable in staying where I put it around my waist. The strap slips and loosens a bit over time. Just don't move or walk and it will stay put. But seriously it's not that bad.

### Durability

Being of neoprene and large, durable zippers, it is sufficiently durable for my uses, which include walking, sitting, driving, and that's about it.

## Conclusion

It was a gift that I asked for. Would I buy one for myself? Yes, but I'd buy the [knockoff]({{<amazon "B09221VHWX">}}). There may be a better design out there that doesn't slip, or I may be able to engineer a solution. I like it and I don't care if it's not cool. It's the coolest looking uncool accessory I've ever had.
