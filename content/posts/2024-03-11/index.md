[This GIR spatula]({{<amazon "B0177MBROQ">}}). At least GIR is an acronym this time and not just an angry typo.
<!--more-->
## Description

It's a black silicone spatula, a bit on the small side.

## Narrative

"Nonstick" is an understatement. We bought it on [Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/)'s recommendation. It's a bit *too* nonstick for me.

### Functionality

It flips eggs. It's not stiff enough to separate the whites of eggs that have run together. It's too slippery to hold onto eggs and they sometimes slide off too soon. This can be bad news when going from the pan to the plate, so I have adapted by moving my plate as close as possible to the pan.

### Quality

The quality is fine. The tapered edge is a nice touch. It's smooth pretty much everywhere.

### Reliability

It's reliably slippery, all of the time.

### Durability

The silicone hasn't melted, cracked, or deformed, so I'd say it's pretty durable. I don't leave it in the pan or touching hot surfaces for very long. Maybe I could....

## Conclusion

I probably wouldn't buy this again if it's for eggs. It's super easy to clean but has practically no coefficient of friction, so it's not perfect. [This nylon one]({{<amazon "B01E8NH1OW">}}) is much better, at least for making fried eggs. And yet, I keep using it. In fact, I use it almost every day. So maybe it's okay after all. Maybe it's one of those frustrating things that you get used to and would miss if absent, which has some ineffable qualities that you can't quite put your finger on. Then again, maybe I just don't care all that much. After all, it *is* a spatula.
