[ICEBREAKER POP]({{<amazon B09VRH86S2>}}) is another product that shouts its name at you, like the caps lock key is stuck on.

## Description

A fully-enclosed ice cube tray that you can store in any orientation in the freezer.

## Narrative

We bought these trays for our [RV](http://rangeline.info) but it turns out we use them in our house, too. The design is such that you fill them with water, seal them up, and then put them in the freezer whichever way you want. No worries about spilling them. Perfect for a moving vehicle, right?

We originally bought one of each different color with the idea to rotate them back-to-front in the freezer. This way we could tell which had been in the freezer the longest and was therefore the most likely to be frozen, i.e., ice. (Water cubes are infinitely less useful than ice cubes.) The intention was to use them on road trips instead of having to buy ice along the way.

But the well water in this house is so stinky that I use filtered water in these trays for my ice in lieu of the fridge's built-in ice maker (which is horrible, by the way, but that's a review for another day).

They take a bit of getting used to, but if you both *read* and *follow* the directions, you'll be fine. Also, do the directions *in order*. That's important.

### Functionality

The clear ones are the clear winners because you can see where the water level is when filling. What good is a fill line on an opaque plastic? You'd need a strong flashlight to fill those trays correctly. And I don't want to have to equip myself just to refill the ice cube trays.

### Quality

They are rigid plastic and some kind of flexible plastic or rubbery material, about what would be expected based on the price.

### Reliability

A couple of times I noticed a small amount of water had leaked through one of the joints, but they have never failed to make ice. So I could call them 100% reliable.

### Durability

For me they have held up pretty well so far. No problems.

## Conclusion

So I didn't think I'd be using these as much as I would, but I do. They're an everyday item for me. They alleviate the worry of spillage, which was my primary gripe with traditional ice cube trays. I would definitely buy them again, but only in a [clear]({{<amazon B09VRH86S2>}})/see-though color.
