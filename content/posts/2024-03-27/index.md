## Description
Space Black with 128GB of storage. Model A2650 or MPXT3LL/a
## Narrative
I left android. They will always win in the new features category. I don’t want that anymore. I just want something that works, all the time, every time. The iPhone is closer to that idea(l). Apple lags in the whiz bang features. That’s okay by me.
