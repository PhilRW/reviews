Dun dun dunn! My iPhone, an [Apple iPhone 14 Pro]({{<amazon "B0BN95FRW9">}}). A too expensive thing that is almost always on me.
<!--more-->
## Description

It's the middle-sized iPhone option and it came in Space Black with 128GB of storage. Model A2650 or MPXT3LL/a. It has an all-glass front, an all-glass back, and three glass camera lenses that protrude quite substantially from the back. It also has an LED on the back for camera flash/flashlight, as well as a lidar sensor. The front has sensors and a camera in what Apple calls a "dynamic island," made possible by its OLED display.

## Narrative

I left Android. They will always win in the new features category. I don’t want that anymore. I just want something that works, all the time, every time. The iPhone is *closer* to that idea(l). Apple lags in the whiz bang features. That’s okay by me. I'd still be on the iPhone SE if I didn't want a better camera on me at all times.

### Functionality

Good golly, it has every function you could want in a smartphone, unless you like extremely cutting-edge functions. It has a great camera, GPS, internet connectivity, and it makes video and audio calls, too. It has apps for everything, including email, calendar, social media, games, and everything else.

### Quality

Superb.

### Reliability

Also very good, rarely do I have to restart it because of a glitch or a freeze, which is usually attributable to an app.

### Durability

Not so much. I dropped the display on a rock and then I needed a new display. I now have AppleCare for as long as I am working in a hazardous (to phones) environment.

## Conclusion

I like it and would absolutely buy another one. I don't need the latest and (incrementally) greatest model. Apple is just making minor improvements to an already very mature product at this point. I'm waiting for the next disruptive innovation in this space, but in the meantime I will happily enjoy my [iPhone]({{<amazon "B0BN95FRW9">}}).
