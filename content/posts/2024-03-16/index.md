Let's examine this 10 oz. Yeti lowball.
<!--more-->
## Description

It's a short, stout, stainless steel, vacuum insulated, double walled liquid holder that keeps cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot. It holds 10 oz. of liquid. Mine does not stack and is not avilable anymore new: [this]({{<amazon "B0BTTWD4VD">}}) is the newer version that is stackable.

## Narrative

We decided to buy some Yetis many years ago for a few reasons: we wanted more durable drinkware that doesn't sweat and keeps drinks colder longer. This is the smaller of the three sizes we have and gets the second-most amount of use. 10 oz. is just enough for me to be only moderately annoyed by the extra cognitive load incurred while calculating the amount of calories in my drink, since 8 fl. oz. is the typical "serving size."

Drinking from stainless steel drinkware takes a little bit of adjustment from glassware. It feels different and even tastes a bit different at first. But that's just your brain. Soon you will crave the texture of the brushed stainless metal as it caresses your orifice.

### Functionality

It is dishwasher safe, but not microwave safe. I don't think. I've never tried it. Put some ice water in it before bedtime and there will still be ice the next morning. Hot liquids cool down too slowly drink, so adjust your heating regimen accordingly. Honestly I don't use this for hot liquids 'cause I don't drink coffee. I usd it a few times for tea and went back to the steeper temperature curve of ceramics for those rare occasions.

For extra staying-cool efficiency, pre-cool your Yeti by storing it in the fridge or rinsing it with some cold water prior to pouring your drink.

### Quality

The Yeti logo on the bottom is parallel to the Yeti logo on the side. It's nice that they care about these details. Some less expensive knockoffs do not.

### Reliability

As a completely passive device, it's never let me down. It's the [Rick Astley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) of drinkware. The lid fits on snugly with a gasket and keeps its contents from spilling.

### Durability

Where glassware would shatter when dropped, this just dents. Sadly we've dropped these a few times but none of our 10 oz. Yetis have dents in them -- yet.

## Conclusion

This size Yeti is perfect for a glass of milk, especially if you want to come back to it later (or you accidentally forget about it for a while). But why would you when it's only 10 oz.? I would buy these again, or even buy more of them.
