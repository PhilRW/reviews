Let's take a look at the [Apple Watch SE]({{<amazon "B08KDBXX1S">}}).

## Description

This is the first edition of the Apple Watch SE (with GPS), their less expensive version, introduced in 2020. Specifically, I have model [A2352](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204507).

## Narrative

I've had this since ... wow ... November of 2021. That's a long time for me and watches. I've worn it pretty much every day since then.

I have a long history with high-teh watches. I've had a Casio calculator watch, solar-powered radio-synchronized watch, Citizen Promaster chronograph watch, minute repeater watch, Pebble Time Steel smartwatch, and PineTime smartwatch, to name (more than) a few. The Apple Watch is the one I now wear. Primarily because it's the best of the bunch, and also because it's the only one I have left. 

### Functionality

### Quality

Top-notch.

### Reliability

### Durability

It's lasted for more than 2 years of everyday use. I've always had [this OtterBox case]({{<amazon "B0CP4K9YGX">}}) on it (a review for another day), so that may have contributed to its longevity. I like that it's waterproof and I've taken it swimming. Just remember to turn on the water mode first.
