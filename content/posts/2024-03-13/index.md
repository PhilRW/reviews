Let's take a look at my [Apple Watch SE]({{<amazon "B08KDBXX1S">}}).

## Description

This is the first edition of the Apple Watch SE, their less expensive version, introduced in 2020. Specifically, I have model [A2352](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204507), which comes with GPS.

## Narrative

I've had this since ... wow ... November of 2021. That's a long time for me and watches. I've worn it pretty much every day since then.

I have a long history with high-tech watches. I've had a Casio calculator watch, solar-powered radio-synchronized watch, Citizen Promaster chronograph watch, minute repeater watch, Pebble Time Steel smartwatch, and PineTime smartwatch, to name (more than) a few. The Apple Watch is the one I now wear. Primarily because it's the best of the bunch, and also because it's the only one I have left. 

### Functionality

I have a bone to pick about the latest software update. They totally changed what all the things do. The button, the crown, swiping up from the bottom of the screen, they're all *different* now. What about my muscle memory?! Come one, Apple, at least give me the *option* of using the old way. Not a good UX in this case.

Otherwise, it has every function you could possibly want in a smartwatch. It acts as an extension of your iPhone. It tracks my heart rate, sleep, activity, has a bunch of apps to make things oh-so-convenient (see: [OurGroceries](https://www.ourgroceries.com/), for one), and, oh yeah, it tells time, too. You never have to set it.

The battery still lasts about a day. I take it off to charge it an hour or so before I go to sleep and it also gets a few minutes of charge in the morning when I shower. Other than that it is on my wrist all the time.

Newer and more expensive models have always-on displays or other fancier doo-dads or specs. I don't miss them. The core functionality of the watches are the same. The only thing I might appreciate more is an always-on display for those times when I can't flick my wrist up in exactly the right way to get the display to turn on and I can't use my other hand to wake it up (e.g., when riding a scooter).

### Quality

Top-notch. I am generally a fan of their products. There is a subtle curvature of the glass face as it approaches the bezel, it's a nice touch.

### Reliability

Very rarely do I encounter a bug or a glitch with the watch, and when I do, it's usually attributable to 3rd party applications. Worst case scenario is I have to restart the watch to fix the problem, but I have only had to do that a handful of times. Other than that, it has near 24/7 uptime with the exception of software updates.

### Durability

It's lasted for more than 2 years of everyday use. I've always had [this OtterBox case]({{<amazon "B0CP4K9YGX">}}) on it (a review for another day), so that may have contributed to its longevity. I like that it's waterproof and I have taken it swimming many times. Just remember to turn on the water mode first.

## Conclusion

If you have an iPhone and are considering a smart watch, the Apple Watch is your choice. You can't go wrong with any model, which is why I [the least expensive one I could find]({{<amazon "B08KDBXX1S">}}).
