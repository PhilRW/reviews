Finally we have our solitary [Yeti 30 oz. tumbler]({{<amazon "B073WJSYMM">}}).
<!--more-->
## Description

It's a tall, stainless steel, vacuum insulated, double walled liquid holder that keeps cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot. It holds 30 oz. of liquid.

## Narrative

Why would you need 30 oz. of *hot* liquid? 30 oz. is a lot of liquid. We only have one of these. Lately it's been used as an iced ~~diuretic~~ coffee vessel. See the [20]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-19#narrative">}}) and the [10]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-18#narrative">}}) for the rest of the story.

### Functionality

Like the [20]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-19#functionality">}}) and the [10]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-18#functionality">}}), it's been through the dishwasher. It's too big for the top rack, so it goes on the bottom. The lid is a different size than the others, and we have but one. It flares out in size about halfway up in order to hold the rest of the drink reservoir you might need for your trip across the Sahara. They make it this shape (presumably) to fit in your hand and cupholders, although you will need more of the latter because lifting this amount of liquid for any appreciable length of time requires strong muscles and proper form.

### Quality

The same as the [20]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-19#quality">}}) and the [10]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-18#quality">}}), which is to say very good.

### Reliability

The same as the [20]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-19#reliablity">}}) and the [10]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-18#reliability">}}), which is to say also very good.

### Durability

The same as the [20]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-19#reliablity">}}) and the [10]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-18#reliability">}}), which is to say still also very good. Note, due to the mass of this when fully loaded, please wear steel-toed boots if you are prone to dropping things on your feet.

## Conclusion

If the [20 oz. size]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-19">}}) is too small for you, then this is your next choice. Perhaps you are the size of [André](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/André_the_Giant), in which case you will need more than one of these. Perhaps you enjoy being especially hydrated. Perhaps you like holding large things in an effort to make yourself look smaller by comparison. In any of these cases, the [30 oz. Yeti tumbler]({{<amazon "B073WJSYMM">}}) is for you. It keeps your drinks just as cold as the others. Due to its massive top surface area, be cautious of for solar radiation absorption and climatic changes in your general vicinity.
