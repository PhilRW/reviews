Today I review my [Ego 24" Snowblower]({{<amazon "B09PWBP1QC">}}). It's electric.
<!--more-->
## Description

It's a 24" wide 2-stage self-propelled electric snowblower, model [SNT2406-4](https://egopowerplus.com/two-stage-snow-blower-snt2400/). It has LED lights, an adjustable chute, variable speed auger, variable speed forward, reverse, and slots for two batteries. Mine came with 4 10Ah batteries and a dual charger. [Here it is]({{<amazon "B09PWBP1QC">}}) with 2 10Ah batteries.

## Narrative

We currently live on a property with a ridiculously long driveway. Like 300' long. That's long for our area. We tried to weather the first winter with a smaller snowblower. It did not go well. This bigger one is going *much* better. üòÅ

### Functionality

It really is amazing what this thing can do. It can move a lot of snow. Okay, well, that's about it. Let me start again: It really is amazing how well this thing can do the one thing it can do. I wouldn't use it for anything else. But when you need it, you need it. It has a continuously variable auger speed control, as well as the same for forward drive. It also has a reverse direction. (No, it doesn't put snow back in your path, it just moves backward.)

It has LED lights which I've actually used to clear snow in the dark. It has chute direction and angle adjustments so you can precisely throw the snow where you want it to go. But it's all a manual thing, there's no automatic function that turns the snow chute when I turn directions. That would be awesome. And probably super expensive. I could see adding cameras, a computer, and more electric motors to one of these babies, along with AI software that precisely calculates the snow velocity and trajectory. But I digress.

It has a plastic rod for chipping/ramming the snow out of a clogged chute, which can happen frequently or not at all depending on the quality of the snow it's throwing. Don't blame the snowblower for the weather.

Depending on the amount of snow, I may have to swap battery sets a couple of times. With four batteries I can be charging one set/pair while I use the other. Usually anything less than half a foot of snow and I don't have to swap batteries. But remember, we have a ridiculously long driveway. In any typical (sub)urban situation this thing would be a bit overkill.

The batteries have built-in level indicators which you can theoretically see through the translucent battery slot cover. But it always gets snow on it (duh), so I can't see the battery levels without wiping it off and I'm not going to do that; I just use it until it stops.

### Quality

It's a mix of metal where it needs it and plastic where it doesn't. The quality is good for what it is and what it does, while keeping its weight under control. (I wish I could say the same for myself.)

Perhaps there is a batter design where the chute doesn't get clogged with slushy snow, but for now I consider it a skill that I just haven't developed yet. I just probably need to run the impeller faster.

### Reliability

Electric motors and lithium batteries means it will always go until it won't anymore. And it always goes. I store it in the garage and do literally nothing to it until I need it again.

I suppose this is why I purchase electric things that have traditionally been gas engine powered. I value reliability.

### Durability

We have had this for 1 1/2 snow seasons, so time will tell how well it holds up. I expect to have to replace various parts over the years but as of yet I can say it's durable enough to make it through two Colorado Front Range winters. Which is to say, it hasn't been taxed.

## Conclusion

I would buy another one of these, especially if I had any appreciable amount of pavement to keep clear (which I do, for now). I probably wouldn't get one if I just had a smallish urban or suburban driveway and lived in a climate that didn't get a lot of snow and/or had a pretty mild winter climate. It's not expensive compared to the alternatives, according to both my pocketbook and my back, when I factor in long term maintenance. (Long term maintenance? Of which? The snowblower or my pocketbook or my back? The answer is: ...Yes.)
