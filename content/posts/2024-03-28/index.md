My fridge's ice maker.
<!--more-->
## Description

It's the built-in icemaker on Samsung refrigerator model RF27T5501SR/AA. It's a through-the door model with cubed ice, crushed ice, and water. The icemaker is in the refrigerator part of the fridge.

## Narrative

This came with the house. It will go with the house. It was new when we moved in and it worked for about a year, then the problems. It gets jammed. It freezes shut and fills up with ice so the mechanism gets jammed and we can't remove the ice tray. Techs have come out three times to fix it and it still doesn't work. 

### Functionality

It's pretty simple: three buttons. Water, Cubed Ice, and Crushed Ice. You can switch between them while depressing the dispense button, which is nice.

### Quality

The ice cubes are your typical residential refrigerator ice cubes, which is to say cloudy/lots of air. 

### Reliability

It is 99% not reliable. It's a crapshoot as to whether we will get ice to work or not on any particular day, and the odds favor the house. Oh there's ice in there, it just won't come out. Some problems we've encountered: it jams, it freezes up, it only dispenses crushed ice when either is selected. The only bright side is that Samsung has sent a technician out free of charge. But three times. So far.

### Durability

It hasn't worked long enough for me to be able to comment on its durability. Nothing has technically broken on it yet, it seems to work exactly as designed. It's the design that's flawed.

## Conclusion

Simply put, I would not buy this particular fridge with icemaker again. We have resorted to using [ice cube trays]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-09">}}). We might consider buying a fridge with an icemaker but we are leaning heavily against any automatic dispense mechanism.
