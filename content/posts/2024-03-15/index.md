My pocketknife, a Doug Ritter Mini-[RSK Mk1](http://www.dougritter.com/dr_rsk_mk1.htm).
<!--more-->
## Description

It's a folding S30V steel pocket knife with a black handle and a pocket clip that says Benchmade on it. The blade says Doug Ritter S30V on one side and has the Benchmade logo on the other.

## Narrative

I don't know how long I've had this, but it must be at least a decade. I read somewhere that a true gentleman always carries a pocketknife on him, so I bought this one. It was expensive at the time - I think around $100. But it's the last one I'll ever need.

### Functionality

The blade flicks open with your thumb or a flick of the wrist if you're holding the lock open. It closes by opening the lock and folding closed the blade into the handle. The lock is ambidextrous, as is the belt clip. The size fits perfectly in my hand and is legal to carry around everywhere, as far as I know. But I am not a lawyer. I don't even play one on TV, that's how much I am not a lawyer.

### Quality

Practically bulletproof, figuratively speaking. Taking a closer look at it, I notice there's a couple of small indents on the short edges, perhaps where it hit something. The rest of it looks well worn, I guess? I really can't tell. Other than the black finish having rubbed off of the belt clip many years ago, it still looks pretty darn good. 

### Reliability

It has never failed me. I think one time the mechanism got gunked up and wouldn't operate smoothly, but I took it apart and cleaned it and it's been fine ever since.

### Durability

Benchmade has a free lifetime sharpening service where you can mail it to them and they'll sharpen it to within an inch of it's life. I've never done it.

That doesn't mean that it's still as sharp as the day I got it. Currently it is not. I just prefer to sharpen my own knives.

I've used the blade to cut some things it shouldn't have (see: wires) and consequently there are some small notches in the blade where there shouldn't be. They'll work out in time as I sharpen it.

## Conclusion

This is always on me and it always works. I would absolutely purchase it again. Unfortunately, I they don't make this exact model anymore, but you may find [something newer of the same lineage](https://knifeworks.com/dr/).
