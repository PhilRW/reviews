And let's also look at this [Yeti 20 oz. tumbler]({{<amazon "B073WK182F">}}), the most popular of our drinkware sizes.
<!--more-->
## Description

It's a tall, stainless steel, vacuum insulated, double walled liquid holder that keeps cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot. It holds 20 oz. of liquid.

## Narrative

The story is the same for this size as it is for the [10 oz. version]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-18#narrative">}}), except we decided to buy a couple more of this size because we thought we'd use them more. And we did. Again, it's not 16 oz. but 20 oz. so if you want to figure out how many Calories you're drinking, some math is involved.

### Functionality

These have also been through the dishwasher many times. We mostly use them for cold drinks, as hot drinks are more appropriate for the [smaller size]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-18#functionality">}}). The [magnetic slider lids]({{<amazon "B01N8VT1D8">}}) keep the liquid in when they get accidentally knocked over by, oh, say, a clumsy toddler. If yours doesn't come with one, get one.

### Quality

On par with the [10 oz. Yeti]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-18#quality">}}). Well made and good attention to detail.

### Reliability

Same as the [10 oz. version]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-18#reliability">}}). 

### Durability

Same as the [10 oz. version]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-18#durability">}}), but they're a bit bigger so they have a bit more mass when you drop them. We have one with some damage on the bottom edge where it impacted a parking lot. Oh well.

## Conclusion

These are used more often than the [10 oz. ones]({{<ref "posts/2024-03-18">}}) we have because they hold more liquid but are not harder to hold. In fact, they're a bit narrower at the bottom and therefore go more places (i.e., fit more cupholders).
