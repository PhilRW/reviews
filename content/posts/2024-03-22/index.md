Today I shine some light on the [ThuNite Archer 2A V3 LED flashlight]({{<amazon "B08H1NTK82">}}).

## Description

It's a small, black, metal flashlight with a single LED, a button to change brightness, and an on/off tailcap switch. It takes two AA batteries.

## Narrative

We needed a flashlight, so on Wirecutter's recommendation we tried this one. I've had a lot of flashlights over the years, mostly freebies from various places: some small squeeze LED ones that are supposed to go on your keychain, or some larger yet still smallish ones that you get for free from Harbor Freight, or just old junk drawer ones. But I wanted a single, good flashlight that was small enough to carry with me but bright enough to be useful.

### Functionality

First off, it takes regular AA batteries. That is a big convenience. I use rechargeable, low-self-discharge AA batteries.

The on-off switch is on the cap, as well as a couple of lanyard holes. The flashlight remembers your last brightness setting. Pressing the button on the top toggles dim/low/medium/high brightness, in that order, then it cycles around, so you're never more than 3 presses away from the setting you want. So long as you can figure out what brightness it's currently on. Which is never easy, because vision is all relative and subjective and stuff. Meaning my eyes do not have a light meter built in. So sometimes I think it's on medium when it's on high or vice versa and I end up having to press the button a few more times than necessary. A multiposition slide switch would have been better for that purpose.

But then you couldn't activate the strobe function by pressing and holding the button. Another press returns to your previous brightness setting. Toggling on/off does not remember the strobe function. It flashes at maximum brightness at, oh, say, around 10 Hz or so, give or take 3 Hz. That's just a guess. It's just flashy enough to get your attention and to be annoying indoors when pointed at my face by my child.

While round, it has a hexagonal ridge to keep it from rolling. You could stand it up on its end, but only with the light facing down.

It also has a pocket clip.

The one we have has a warmer color temperature LED in it. Others have the option of a cooler color temperature LED.

### Quality

It's machined aluminum with some kind of plastic lens over the LED. The end cap has a rubber button on the end for on/off and it screws in place nice and snugly with the aid of a rubber gasket, and it is well made.

### Reliability

It is a very reliable flashlight, so long as there is charge in the batteries. But it lets you know well ahead of time that it's running low, because it gets dim and the brightest setting starts looking like the dimmest setting.

### Durability

I'm sure we've dropped it a few times and so far it has come out undented. The durability of the LED bulb helps. And the aluminum body.

## Conclusion

I like this [flashlight]({{<amazon "B08H1NTK82">}}). It's small but packs a pretty big punch for its size. I'd buy one again, but I hope this one will last for a good long time.
