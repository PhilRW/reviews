Today I will be reviewing this glass of milk.
<!--more-->
Not all milk, mind you, and not a particular grade of milk, nor even any milk from a particular carton. I'm referring to a single, 8 oz. glass of milk.

This particular glass of milk came from a carton of organic, ultrapasteurized 2% milk from Costco.

It was the perfect temperature, primarily thanks to the settings on our refrigerator. The flavor was typically milk-like, as it should be, and the consistency was smooth and liquid, as expected. No hints of being sour at all, thanks to its ultrapasteurization.

Now it's not as good as milk I've had from local dairies, but right now we don't get milk delivered, so we have to go to the store and get it. And it's 100% okay. I've never had a problem with this milk. Sometimes the cartons leak but I test that in the store through my rigorous process (I set them on their side in the cart).

In summation, it was refreshing and just what I needed in the moment. I think I'll have another one. Maybe this time with some cookies...
