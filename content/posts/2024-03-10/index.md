Today I will be reviewing this glass of milk.
<!--more-->
## Description

A cold glass of milk.

## Narrative
Not all milk, mind you, and not a particular grade of milk, nor even any milk from a particular carton. I'm referring to a single, 8 oz. glass of milk.

This particular glass of milk came from a carton of organic, ultrapasteurized 2% milk from Costco.

It was the perfect temperature, primarily thanks to the settings on our refrigerator. The flavor was typically milk-like, as it should be, and the consistency was smooth and liquid, as expected. No hints of being sour at all, thanks to its ultrapasteurization.

Now it's not as good as milk I've had from local dairies, but right now we don't get milk delivered, so we have to go to the store and get it. And it's 100% okay. I've never had a problem with this milk. Sometimes the cartons leak but I test that in the store through my rigorous process (I set them on their side in the cart).

### Functionality

This milk functions perfectly as a liquid, which is as per design specifications. It does not remain in the cold state for long due to entropy.

### Quality

It is wet and cold.

### Reliability

It is reliably wet and cold.

### Durability

It would only remain cold for a short time, and it will remain wet for a bit longer than that. It is adequately durable for its purpose.

## Conclusion

In summation, it was refreshing and just what I needed in the moment. I think I'll have another one. Maybe this time with some cookies...
